  <h2 id="workpattern-v060--21-feb-2021">Workpattern v0.6.0 ( 21 Feb, 2021)</h2>

<p>I stopped keeping this Changelog file update back when v0.5.0 was realeased on 19 Oct 2016 and now it is 10Feb 2021 and I’m playing catch-up.
I have created the following set of bullet point changes by going through my commit messages, the quality of which varies greatly.<br />
A lot of the effort has been on making the code easier to read as it was a real mess.
Here is a chronological take on what I have been doing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>removed test warnings by surrounding ambiguous negatives with parenthesis</li>
  <li>I think a bug was fixed by changing #wee_total and #total to just an attr_writer</li>
  <li>removed some duplicated code</li>
  <li>replaced a number of literals with constants which I put in their own file</li>
  <li>made a lot of the code easier to read, such as extracting to a method with a sensible name or renaming existing ones</li>
  <li>Workpattern is now tested on Ruby 1.9.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, ruby-head, jruby-19mode &amp; jruby-head</li>
  <li>Created a Day class to remove the complexity from Week so Week deals with weeks and Day with a day</li>
  <li>My Clock class was replaced by Time or Date objects in all tests.  Clock only used for internal stuff now.</li>
  <li>Switched to sorted_set rubygem after the SortedSet class was removed from Ruby in v3.x.</li>
  <li>Workpattern now works with ruby 3.0.1dev</li>
  <li>added Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</li>
</ul>

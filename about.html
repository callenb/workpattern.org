  <p>My name is Barrie Callender and I originally wrote the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/workpattern">Workpattern rubygem</a> to learn Ruby and then how to write Ruby properly.  I’m still working on that second part.</p>

<p>The original Workpattern v0.0.1 was released on July 25, 2009.  I am writing this on 21st February 2021 and the most recent 0.5.0 version was released on Octoner 19, 2016.  However, I am about to release version 0.6.0 which has had a big rewrite to begin to untangle the mess it was in.  It is faster and the code is now easier to read than it was.  It still needs to improve before I begin to add features.</p>

<p>I hope to use this site to provide some examples of how one could use this rubygem, and along the way I hope to become better at programming Ruby.  I also hope to learn more about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which this site runs on.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in learning the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> programming language and maybe develop the Workpattern library for it.</p>

<p>We’ll see.</p>
